What's this
-------------------------------------
MogreGis3D is software written in C# that enables you to visualize, query, and manipulate GIS 
data from within an 3D application. In short, you can generate spatially accurate 3D geometry 
from GIS data layers while maintaining connectivity to the GIS data sources. 

This project borrows the osgGis design but adapted to C# and using Mogre for 3D visualization.

--osgGis team
They provided the original osgGis project. 
Thanks a lot guys!

--Mogre team
They provided the amazing C++/CLI wrapper for the Ogre 3D engine (www.ogre3d.org)

--SharpMap team
They are a fantastic team doing geo-spatial on .net / mono platforms. Its library provides access to 
many types of GIS data, enables spatial querying of that data, and renders beautiful maps. 
The engine is written in C#.
